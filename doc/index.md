# VDS ROBDD Project

In the course of this Lab assignment, students are going to implement a minimal BDD package in C++. This package implements the fundamental manipulation methods for ROBDDs as they were introduced in the lecture *Verification of Digital Systems* by Prof. Kunz. The package will be implemented using the Test Driven Development (TDD) paradigm presented by Dr. Wedler.
